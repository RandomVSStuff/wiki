Land claiming in this server takes a more hardcore approach, where you need to upkeep a claim, and keep your blocks reinforced.

## Block Reinforcement & Locking

Block reinforcement is the principal method of making sure your stuff doesn't move. You can achieve block reinforcement by using stones, mortar, or metals, and using either a plumb and square, or to reinforce a larger area, a plumb and cube. When you reinforce a block, it makes it to where you have to break the block more times(dependent on the metal) to actually remove the block. You can also create padlocks to protect your chest and doors from being interacted with once you reach the bronze age.

## City and Fort Flags

City and Forts are the primary way to have your settlement protected. Once you place either a City or Fort Flag, you will now be protected according to the [[Banditry & Raiding]] rules! A flag will prevent others from placing blocks within a certain radius of the flag. The Fort Flags radius is 50, meanwhile, the cities flag radius, is 150.  The city flag will use more food per day as a consequence of its larger radius.

In order to set up your flag, you must first craft either a Fort or City Flag, have extra food to sustain the settlement, and a plain cloth. When you place down your flag, ensure you have vessels(recommended) or any other way to store food, right by the flag, and have food in the vessel.![[flag1.png]]
Once you have the vessel and flag placed, you can attach the cloth, and hold right click to raise it, once it is finished raising, you will get a notification saying you can name your stronghold! ![[flag2.png]]
Now since that is done, you will see in the block selection, how long your flag will last with the amount of food you have supplied. 

Here are some additional commands to start getting the settlement going.

/stronghold name <name>
This command lets you rename the stronghold you are currently standing in.

/stronghold league <group>
This will allow you to add a group the list of people who can build within the settlement

/stronghold stopleague <group>
This will revoke a groups permission to build within the settlement.

You can also use logic posts within a claim, to add food from a cellar to your flag duration. 
Other players can build Gabions in your claim regardless of group affiliation.
