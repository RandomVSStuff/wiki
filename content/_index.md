# Welcome to First Dawn

Navigate the world, create cultures, friendships, rivalries, and all other sorts of adventures. In the harsh, late middle-ages landscape of the server.

# Next Steps

This server has some significant changes to the base game. You will not have a map to start with, and as such you will have to make yourself an Atlas to access your map and waypoints.
[[Making an Atlas]]
If you decide to go it alone, or begin a new settlement, to be protected by raid and war rules, you need to have an active settlement flag to protect your town, this will use food, as a means of protection.
[[Land Claiming & Protection]]
Once your settlement is ready to enter into its agrarian era, you will to check out the changes to farming times, as they drastically change your planting/harvesting season.
[[Farming & Times]]
