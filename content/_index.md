# Welcome to (Insert Server Name Here xD)
This is a whitelisted Homo-Sapiens Worldbuilding/Civ server. This really increases the difficulty for progression substantially, as you no longer have a map of any kind, no coordinates to help, and only vague prospecting information, with no precision finding. 

Navigate the world, create cultures, friendships, rivalries, and all other sorts of adventures. In the harsh, late middle-ages landscape of the server.

# Additional Information
The servers main interaction will be in game, although there is a discord server and forum thread, it is primarily for updates, or non-ingame interactions,  such as planning events, asking for help, or showing off builds. You can join the Discord [here]([https://discord.gg/QrGBeDWcfC](https://discord.gg/QrGBeDWcfC "https://discord.gg/QrGBeDWcfC")), or check out the forum post [here](https://www.vintagestory.at/forums/topic/13598-gauging-interest-in-a-homo-sapiens-civ-server/).
