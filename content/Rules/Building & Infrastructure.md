The time period of the server is anywhere from paleolithic, to late medieval! While there won't be an enforced build code or anything of the sorts, please refrain from building modern houses, or anything along those lines. Also try to your best to follow the style around you, if people are making more European builds, its probably not best to build an Ancient Greek Megapolis right next door!
