Banditry allows for a more fun approach to the world, however it shouldn't be the main objective of a player.

Here are some general guidelines,
1) If you are asked to stop by a member of the staff, that is your only warning
2) Do not target an individual person, or town, if you are found to be doing so, you will be asked to stop.
3) Do not make banditry a daily habit, or even frequent, and try not to be nuisance about it.
4) Roadside banditry is always the ideal form, since it doesn't massively interrupt another players progress.
5) Banditry does not allow for stealing from someone's house. This is covered under raiding. Local laws may punish those who steal, but in general, if you are stealing from a town that isn't yours,  it will lead to a warning and possibly further consequences.
## Raiding
Raiding is something that can occur to cause tension, conflict, or just show who's boss. Sometimes it's necessary that for one village to survive, another must be ransacked.

1)  Do not raid excessively, at most once a week
2) The purpose of a raid shouldn't be to devastate another town
3) You should never raid a town that is offline, doing so will result in a warning.
4) Spawn killing is not allowed, doing so will result in a warning
5) The wealth you steal from a town shouldn't exceed more than half of what you can see. If it is determined this has happened,  a staff member will intervene.
6) If you want to raid, their must be a minimum of two members of the victims town online, and you can at most have twice as many people raiding, as people  defending the town. Things are meant to be fun, not annoying.
